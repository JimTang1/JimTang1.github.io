                    <h2>Sunny/Clear</h2>
                     <p>A sunny day, or clear sky during nighttime, 
                    is when there is no cloud above the horizon. 
                    If one is at the top of a mountain or travel in a plane, 
                    possible clouds and fogs don't count as long as they remain below 
                    the horizon level. This also means that the sky is always sunny/clear 
                    above the highest altitude at which clouds can generate, 
                    which is about 85,340 meters (53 miles). 
                    Sunny days are bought by anticyclones.</p>

                    <p>Cloudy weather is when a significant amount of clouds is covering the 
                    sky (at least half the sky). A cloudy day may result in some weak 
                    showers, snowfalls, or even thunderstorms, 
                    although a thunderstorm temporarily overcasts the sky as it happens.</p>

                    <h2>Rain</h2>
                    <p>Rain is the condensed moisture of the atmosphere above falling 
                        under the form of liquid droplets. It is an extremely important 
                        phenomenon that allows life to flourish on continents; 
                        without regular rains, the land turns into a hot desert. 
                        However, strong rains can also cause catastrophic floods, 
                        capable of destroying areas as large as an entire metropolis. 
                        In addition, rain causes other side effects such as slippery roads, 
                        longer braking distances, decreased visibility (pseudo-fog)... 
                        Episodic rains that last only a few minutes are called showers.</p>

                    <h2>Stormy</h2>
                    <p>A thunderstorm is a type of weather characterized by lightning. 
                        There are produced by the largest and tallest clouds that can spawn, 
                        the cumulonimbus. Thunderstorms are also accompanied by strong gusts 
                        of wind, heavy rainfalls, and sometimes hail and tornadoes,
                         which are the most destructive meteorological event. 
                         A thunderstorm, regardless of its intensity, 
                         is always a dangerous phenomenon that should be taken seriously as 
                         lightning can cause great bodily harm, and sometimes even kill, 
                        anyone unfortunate enough to be hit with.</p>
