                        <p>When you climb on wet rocks, you are more than likely going to slip. 
                            We all know that slipping usually means falling and when you fall, it never looks pretty. 
                            No one wants to get hurt from the rock climbing experience.
                        If you find that the rocks are really wet, it is better to go another route. 
                        No matter where you are climbing, you should be able to scope out a few options for routes to take.
                        Don’t climb at all if this isn’t possible because it may not be safe.</p>

                             — a surf forecast will give you more information about the tides. 
                             Tide changes are a good indicator of when you’ll be at the greatest 
                             risk of becoming tangled in a riptide.</p>
