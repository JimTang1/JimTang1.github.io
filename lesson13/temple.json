The site offers scenic mountain views and a convenient location, just a mile from the 800 South exit of I-15. On January 25, 2010, President Thomas S. Monson announced plans for the construction of a new temple in Payson, Utah. He said,\"Temples answer those soul-searching questions of the purpose of life, of why we are here and where we are going. They are sanctuaries from the storms of life and bless the lives of members of the Church who worship within their sacred walls.\" The new temple will serve the growing membership in southern Utah County and help alleviate demands on the heavily attended Provo Utah Temple. This announcement brings the total number of operating and planned temples in Utah to 15.8"

            "TempleSite" : "The Provo City Center Temple stands at the corner of 100 South and University Avenue in Provo's Central Business District. In August 2011, news reports revealed the Church's acquisition of the Provo Travelodge Motel and the Los 3 Amigos Restaurant on the block south of the tabernacle. On September 27, 2011, the third of four properties on the block was secured when the Provo City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency Board, voted unanimously to sign a letter of intent with the Church to sell the site of the old Hotel Roberts. The Howard C. Nielson Post Office stands on the final tract, which is not for sale, but the Church has expressed interest in acquiring.5 NuSkin International has sold its former parking terrace to the Church, located west of the temple, as a new facility has been constructed further west. In early November 2012, the earliest known baptistry of the Church in Utah County was discovered on the site of the Provo City Center Temple. The five-by-nine-foot font was built around 1875 and used until 1906 or so. It had three layers of wood laid in crisscross fashion, fastened by nails and screws. A water pipe to fill and drain the font were also discovered. Large quantities of painted plaster fragments were found, revealing the original sky blue color of the interior walls."
